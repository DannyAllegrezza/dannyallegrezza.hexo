As some may know, I am currently building an [open-source platform](https://github.com/DannyAllegrezza/GT86Registry) for car enthusiasts. As I began my work, I spent a few days spinning my wheels (haha) thinking about the best way to architect the database. I knew I wanted to stick with a trusty RDBMS, however building a clean, normalized model was tricky.

Thankfully, I have some very talented friends to lean on for help, including [Allen Underwood](https://www.codingblocks.net/about/), a fellow software engineer who happens to be a founder of the amazing [Coding-Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/) podcast! In this video, we discuss designing the database and then build out a working schema.
