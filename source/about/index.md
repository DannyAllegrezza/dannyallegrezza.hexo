My name is Danny Allegrezza and I'm happy you've stumbled upon my little space on the web. I'm a software developer who lives and works in the Cary, NC area. I'll be using this blog to write about code, technology, the internet, cars and entrepreneurship. 

## Work Experience
My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannyallegrezza/) profile gives a great overview of my professional work experience. As of recent, I've been working on integrating systems and server-side development. I have spent a lot of time working in the .NET ecosystem, primarily using C#. I have experience with WinForms, WPF, Web Services, Web API and ASP.NET MVC. 

I've worked with additional languages including Java, PHP and some Go. Ultimately, I prefer whatever language is best fit to solve the problem at hand.


## Current Project Cars
